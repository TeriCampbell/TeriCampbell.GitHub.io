#### [Massachusetts Public School Data Project](/Massachusetts Schools internal project)

If you have children, you may wonder what causes one child to succeed and another to struggle. Like myself, you may have heard that smaller class size is important for helping your child to succeed. 

Come take a peek into this analysis and see how that belief may be unfounded, or at least a story not fully told.

Stay tuned to the end and let me know if you agree that perhaps our measures of "success" may need updating.

This project explored factors related to the success of a sales and marketing campaign for a food delivery service.  I wanted to know how the most recent marketing campaign impacted customers' spending preferences in order to inform marketing decisions.
