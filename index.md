#### [Olympic Swim Competition Analysis](/Olympic Swimming Results Analysis)

The next Summer Games come up in 2024.

Growing up as a competitive swimmer, the Summer Olympic Games were always a highlight of the season. The swimming athletes continued to get faster year after year, and at times it appeared that the athletes got younger. Until some star swimmers were highlighted who were in their 30’s and even 40’s. Then came the year that is notorious in the swimming community for the introduction of swim suits with buoyant properties. The suits were worn by swimmers in the 2008 games, but banned for use in the Olympic Games by 2010 due to performance enhancing properties.

This analysis of Olympic Swimming data explores both age and speed of the athletes over the years. In particular, I wanted to highlight the impact that the buoyant suit era had on olympic swimming results, including whether there was a lasting effect and if the times achieved would ever be beaten.

#### [Sports Stats Spotlight: NBA Stats Case Study](/NBA_Project)

Many of my friends and family are basketball fans and knowledgeable in every statistic about every player on every sports team.

I hate to publicly admit it, but probably as a result of ineptitude in sports requiring hand-eye coordination, I have never been terribly knowledgeable in the world of ball sports.

This project is a way for me to jump in with both feet and see what is going on in basketball.

#### [Massachusetts Public School Data Project](/Massachusetts Schools internal project)

If you have children, you may wonder what causes one child to succeed and another to struggle. Like myself, you may have heard that smaller class size is important for helping your child to succeed. 

Come take a peek into this analysis and see how that belief may be unfounded, or at least a story not fully told.

Stay tuned to the end and let me know if you agree that perhaps our measures of "success" may need updating.

This project explored factors related to the success of a sales and marketing campaign for a food delivery service.  I wanted to know how the most recent marketing campaign impacted customers' spending preferences in order to inform marketing decisions.
