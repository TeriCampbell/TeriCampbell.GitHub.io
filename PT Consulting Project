# Group Consulting Project:  Locating a New Physical Therapy Business in Florida
 
## INTRODUCTION

**Overview:**  
This collaborative group healthcare business consulting project utilized data mining and exploration of open source public datasets in order to provide data-informed recommendations to the client.  
<br><br>
###Business Problem: The client wants to open up a new physical therapy clinic in Florida. What are the top 3 locations for the client to open a new location?
<br><br>
**Assumptions:** 

1. The client wants a market in which to grow their business
2. The client will focus on an insurance based payment model and will accept Medicare, which is a growing population.  

**Findings**
Regions that support a greater number of physical therapists have:
* Average age over 38.5 years
* Middle to High average household income
* Larger population

Based on this analysis, a recommendation can be made to consider each of these specific locations as locations for a new physical therapy clinic with local demographic findings that match those of other regions that support higher numbers of physical therapists:
* Lee County, City of Fort Myers, Zip Code 33967
* Charlotte County,City of  Punta Gorda, Zip Code 33982
* Collier County, City of Naples, Zip Code 34117

## DATA

Multiple public sources of data were identified, cleaned using SQL, and combined for this analysis.

Resultant data tables utilized for this business problem:
* uszips.csv - zip codes, population city, coordinates, county 2015-2022

* Fl.csv:  includes clinic locations, provider information, taxonomy codes

* FL_City_Pop.csv:  includes business address, number of providers, city and county names, and zip city population

* FL_Providers_Address.csv: includes business address, city, zip code, and number of providers at each address

Data was cleaned, filtered, and analyzed using spreadsheets, SQL, and Tableau Public

## ANALYSIS

#### Joining the number of providers at each location with the demographic table reveals correlations associated with a higher number of providers.
Introductory exploratory analysis shows that:

* The lowest average age in the top regions that support the greatest number of physical therapists is 38.7
* The city population range in the top regions lies above 524 
* The zip code population range lies above 4700
* The county population range in the top regions is above: 155,000

## RESULTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on this analysis, a recommendation can be made to consider each of these specific locations as locations for a new physical therapy clinic with local demographic findings that match those of other regions that support higher numbers of physical therapists:

* Lee County, City of Fort Myers, Zip Code 33967
* Charlotte County, City of  Punta Gorda, Zip Code 33982
* Collier County, City of Naples, Zip Code 34117

Specifically, we can recommend the individual locations of interest for a new physical therapy clinic with growth potential because the regional demographic fits the following identified criteria and each is relatively under-served compared to areas that support a greater percentage of providers:
* Average age of >38.5
* Middle to High average household income
* Low provider to population ratio
* Higher population

<br><br>
## CONCLUSION & CONSIDERATIONS
Other Considerations/options to pursue deeper:
<br><br>
The data found in these public data sets did not include information on lease prices in each area.
Looking at the client budget vs rent prices (eg. West Palm Beach seems like a good choice, but perhaps there are lower numbers of providers in that location because overhead is restrictive to profit).
<br><br>
Potential for further data exploration:
Average square footage cost for commercial real-estate for each city.
