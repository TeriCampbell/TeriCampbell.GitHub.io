# SQL Hospital Data Project
 
## INTRODUCTION

**Project description:**  This project explored Hospital Data, focusing on diabetic patients in 130 US Hospitals  <br><br>
<br><br>
Hospital readmissions within 30 days of patient discharge can be costly as well as an indication of an inadequate treatment plan.
<br><br>
Greater length of hospital stay can also have a financial impact on the facility due to insurance reimbursement systems such as Medicare’s prospective payment system.
<br><br>
Balancing length of stay with risk of readmission is important for hospital administration and policy.
<br><br>
### The goal of this project was to gain insights and a snapshot view from loans (credits) extended by the International Development Association (IDA) though the World Bank Group.

## DATA

The “diabetic_data” data set was downloaded from Kaggle
The data can be found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/code/iabhishekofficial/prediction-on-hospital-readmission/data?select=diabetic_data.csv

Data was cleaned, filtered, and analyzed using PostgreSQL

The data set contained 101,766 rows and 50 fields

## ANALYSIS

<br><br>
#### First I wanted to know,  ? 
<br><br>
<img src="images/SQL1_top_10_amt_due.png?raw=true" width = "40%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/1Table_top_10_amt_due.png?raw=true" width = "50%"/> 

<br><br>
#### Then which countries had the greatest outstanding amount?
<br><br>
<img src="images/SQL2_Max_owed_to_IDA.png?raw=true" width = "40%"/>    
<br><br>
<img src="images/2Table_max_owed_to_IDA.png?raw=true" width = "50%"/>   

<br><br>
#### Which countries had the greatest number of transactions?
<br><br>
<img src="images/SQL3B_Greatest_Number_of_Transactions.png?raw=true" width = "50%"/>    
<br><br>
<img src="images/3BTable_Greatest_Number_of_Transactions.png?raw=true" width = "60%"/> 

<br><br>
#### Looking deeper, here are the top project categories in India, which was found to have the most outstanding loan amounts 
<br><br>
<img src="images/SQL3_most_frequent_projects_India.png?raw=true" width = "50%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/3Table_most_frequent_projects_India.png?raw=true" width = "55%"/>   

<br><br>
#### Which entity or entities hold the most loan amounts in India?
<br><br>
<img src="images/SQL4_who_has_most_loans_in_India.png?raw=true" width = "60%"/>   
<br><br>
<img src="images/4Table_who_has_most_loans_in_India.png?raw=true" width = "60%"/>   

<br><br>
#### Zooming back out; What percentage of the original loan amount remains unpaid by region?
<br><br>
<img src="images/Table6_Percent_loan_outstanding.png?raw=true" width = "70%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/6SQL_percent_loan_outstanding.png?raw=true" width = "60%"/>  

<br><br>
#### Are the top percentages of unpaid loan amounts in India?
<br><br>
<img src="images/SQL7_Top_percent_outstanding.png?raw=true" width = "70%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/7Table_top_percent_outstanding.png?raw=true" width = "60%"/> 
<br><br>
Looks like they are not

<br><br>
#### Finally, I explored which countries had the longest and shortest scheduled loan durations
<br><br>
<img src="images/Longest Loan Times.png?raw=true" width = "80%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/Table Longest Loan Times.png?raw=true" width = "25%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/Shortest Loan Times.png?raw=true" width = "70%"/>  
<br><br>
<img src="images/Table Shortest Loan Times.png?raw=true" width = "30%"/>  


<br><br>
## RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The above analysis reveals the following:
*  India has the greatest outstanding loan amounts 
*  India also has the largest number of transactions
*  Top project categories for loans in India include telecommunications, social safety nets, and infrastructure
*  The greatest loan amounts in India are held by the Controller of Aid Accounts & Audit
*  India does not appear in the top 10 for longest loan duration; In fact, India appears once in 9th place for the shortest duration loan.

<br><br>
## CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The above insights could be used to further the stated goal of helping meet developing countries needs. 
<br><br>
Following trends over time for countries receiving loans could reveal successes and failures in the lending process and is worth further exploration.
<br><br>
Further research to understand barriers met by loan recipients could provide deeper understanding of each regions specific needs.
